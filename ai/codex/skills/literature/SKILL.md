# Literature Skill

**CRITICAL RULE: Every citation must be verified to exist before inclusion.** Never include a paper you cannot find via web search. Hallucinated citations are worse than no citations.

**PAPERPILE KEY RULE: ALWAYS use Paperpile-format keys (e.g., `Author2016-xx`).** When merging into an existing `.bib`, match existing Paperpile keys. Never generate custom keys (`AuthorYear`, `AuthorKamenica2017`, etc.) or retain non-Paperpile keys unless the user explicitly says otherwise.

**Python:** Always use `uv run python`. Never bare `python`, `python3`, `pip`, or `pip3`.

**PREPRINT RULE: Always prefer the published version.** If a paper is found on arXiv, SSRN, NBER, or any working paper series, search for a published journal/conference version. Only cite a preprint if no published version can be found.

> Comprehensive academic literature workflow: discover, verify, organize, synthesize.
> Uses parallel sub-agents to search multiple sources, verify citations, and fetch PDFs concurrently.

## When to Use

- Starting a new research project
- Writing a literature review section
- Building a reading list on a topic
- Finding specific citations
- Creating annotated bibliographies

## Architecture: Orchestrator + Sub-Agents

```
You (orchestrator)
├── Phase 0: Session log & compact (mandatory — $session-log)
├── Phase 1: Pre-search check (direct — no sub-agent)
├── Phase 2: Parallel search (2-3 Explore agents)
├── Phase 3: Deduplicate + rank (direct — no sub-agent)
├── Phase 4: Parallel verification (general-purpose agents, batches of 5)
├── Phase 5: Parallel PDF download (Bash agents)
├── Phase 6: Assemble .bib (direct — no sub-agent)
└── Phase 7: Synthesize narrative (direct — no sub-agent)
```

**Key principle:** Sub-agents handle independent, parallelizable work. Merging, deduplication, and synthesis stay with you because they need the full picture.

**Full agent prompt templates for all phases:** [references/agent-templates.md](references/agent-templates.md)

---

## Phase 0: Session Log & Compact (Mandatory)

Literature searches are context-heavy. **Always** run `$session-log` before starting to create a recovery checkpoint.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Search Check (Direct)

Check for existing `.bib` files in project root, `$references`, `$bib`, `$bibliography`:

1. Parse existing entries to avoid duplicates and understand context
2. Identify gaps — note if bibliography skews toward certain years/methods
3. Compile list of existing citation keys to pass to sub-agents
4. **Check source availability** — if biblio MCP is configured, call `scholarly_source_status` to see which sources are active (OpenAlex always; Scopus and WoS when API keys are set). If MCP is not configured, continue in web-only mode and report that limitation up front.

---

## Phase 2: Parallel Search (Sub-Agents)

Spawn **2-3 Explore agents in parallel** in a single message, one per source. Read the full prompt templates from [references/agent-templates.md](references/agent-templates.md#phase-2-search-agent-templates).

Available search agents:
1. **Google Scholar** — broad academic search via web
2. **Cross-Source via biblio MCP** (recommended when available) — call `scholarly_search` to query all enabled sources (OpenAlex + Scopus + WoS) with automatic DOI-based deduplication. Returns structured metadata, citation counts, and DOIs — reducing Phase 4 verification work significantly
3. **Semantic Scholar / arXiv** (optional) — CS/ML focused, useful when topic has strong CS overlap
4. **Domain-specific** (optional) — SSRN, NBER, specific journals

**Prefer the biblio MCP `scholarly_search` tool when available.** If MCP is unavailable, run Agent 2 with WebSearch/WebFetch against Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, and publisher pages.

---

## Phase 3: Deduplicate and Rank (Direct)

1. **Merge** results from all search agents
2. **Remove duplicates** — match on title similarity and DOI
3. **Rank** by relevance, citation count, and recency
4. **Select top N** to verify (typically 25-30 candidates for 20-25 verified)
5. **Assign batches** of ~5 for verification

---

## Phase 4: Parallel Verification (Sub-Agents)

**Step 1 — Batch DOI pre-verification (MCP if available):** Collect all DOIs from Phase 3 candidates and call `scholarly_verify_dois` when biblio MCP is configured. This checks each DOI against all enabled sources (OpenAlex, Scopus, WoS). Papers marked VERIFIED (2+ sources confirm) can skip web-based verification. Only SINGLE_SOURCE and NOT_FOUND papers need full manual verification below. If MCP is unavailable, perform direct DOI resolution plus metadata checks for all candidates.

**Step 2 — Manual verification for remaining papers:** Spawn **multiple general-purpose agents in parallel**, each verifying ~5 papers. Read the full verification template from [references/agent-templates.md](references/agent-templates.md#phase-4-verification-agent-template).

Key rules enforced by the template:
- DOI verification is mandatory (resolve and confirm)
- ALL authors must be listed (never "et al." in metadata)
- Preprint check: always search for published version; use `scholarly_search` when MCP is available, otherwise use WebSearch/WebFetch against Crossref/OpenAlex/publisher pages
- Results: VERIFIED / NOT FOUND / METADATA MISMATCH

After all return: collect VERIFIED, drop NOT FOUND, check for remaining duplicates.

---

## Phase 5: Parallel PDF Download (Sub-Agents)

Spawn Bash agents in parallel, 3-5 papers each. Read template from [references/agent-templates.md](references/agent-templates.md#phase-5-pdf-download-agent-template). Best-effort — many papers are behind paywalls.

---

## Phase 6: Assemble Bibliography (Direct)

**Two outputs required:**

1. **`docs/literature-review/literature_summary.bib`** — always created, standalone, self-contained
2. **Project canonical bib** (e.g. `paper/paperpile.bib`) — merge into it if it exists

### BibTeX Format

```bibtex
@article{AuthorYear,
  author    = {Last, First and Last, First},
  title     = {Full Title},
  journal   = {Journal Name},
  year      = {2024},
  volume    = {XX},
  pages     = {1--20},
  doi       = {10.1000/example},
  abstract  = {Abstract text here.}
}
```

Rules:
- Citation keys: use **Paperpile-format keys** (e.g., `Author2016-xx`). If merging into an existing `.bib`, match the key format already in use. Never generate `AuthorYear` keys.
- Only VERIFIED papers — no METADATA MISMATCH entries
- **List ALL authors explicitly** — never "et al." in BibTeX
- Include abstracts when available

---

## Phase 6b: Validate Bibliography (Mandatory)

**After assembling the `.bib`, always run `$validate-bib`.** The Phase 4 verification checks that papers exist, but `$validate-bib` catches a different class of issues:

- Missing required BibTeX fields (journal, volume, pages)
- Preprint staleness (arXiv paper now published in a journal)
- Missing or incorrect DOIs
- Author formatting problems ("et al." in author field, corporate names needing braces)
- Unused entries and possible typos

This is **not optional** — every time new entries are added to a `.bib` file, run the validation before considering the bibliography complete.

---

## Phase 7: Synthesize Narrative (Direct)

1. **Identify themes** — group papers by approach, finding, or debate
2. **Map intellectual lineage** — how did thinking evolve?
3. **Note current debates** — where do researchers disagree?
4. **Find gaps** — what's missing?

Output types: narrative summary (LaTeX), literature deck, annotated bibliography.

---

## Output Structure

```
project/
├── docs/
│   ├── literature-review/
│   │   ├── literature_summary.md      # Thematic narrative (always)
│   │   └── literature_summary.bib     # Standalone .bib (always)
│   └── readings/
│       ├── Smith2024.pdf              # Downloaded PDFs
│       └── ...
└── paper/
    └── paperpile.bib                  # Canonical bib (merge if exists)
```

## Sub-Agent Guidelines

0. **Python: ALWAYS use `uv run python`.** Include this in every sub-agent prompt.
1. **Launch independent agents in a single message** for parallelism
2. **Be explicit in prompts** — sub-agents have no context
3. **Include skip lists** of existing citation keys
4. **Batch sizes:** 5 papers per verification agent, 3-5 per PDF agent
5. **Maximum 3 parallel agents at a time** — spawn in waves, write results to disk between waves. Each agent should write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/lit-search/agent-N.json`) rather than returning large payloads in-context. Summarise from files to avoid context overflow.
6. **Right agent type:** `Explore` for search, `general-purpose` for verification, `Bash` for downloads
7. **Tolerate partial failures** — continue with what you have

## OpenAlex Structured Queries

**Setup:** No fixed local path is required. Use MCP tools when configured; otherwise query the OpenAlex API directly (`https://api.openalex.org`) via WebFetch or `curl`. If your project already has helper scripts, they are optional.

| Workflow | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| Highly-cited papers | Top-cited papers on a topic (filtered by year) |
| Author output | Full publication record for a researcher |
| Institution output | Research output analysis for a university |
| Publication trends | Year-by-year counts for a topic |
| Open-access discovery | Find freely downloadable versions |
| Citation network | Forward citations for a given paper |
| Batch DOI lookup | Verify metadata for multiple papers |

**Full recipes:** [references/openalex-workflows.md](references/openalex-workflows.md)

**MCP server (preferred when configured):** use `openalex_*` and `scholarly_*` tools directly. Prefer MCP over custom scripts because it supports cross-source search and DOI verification in fewer calls. If MCP is unavailable, use OpenAlex API + WebSearch/WebFetch fallback paths described in the references.
