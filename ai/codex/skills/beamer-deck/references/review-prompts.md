# Beamer Deck Review Prompts

> Sub-agent prompts for Phases 5 and 6 of `$beamer-deck`. Also usable by `$quarto-deck` (Phase 5).

## Rhetoric Review (Phase 5)

Evaluate the deck against these criteria and return a structured report:

## 1. Narrative Arc
- Does the deck follow a three-act structure (Problem → Investigation → Resolution)?
- Is the opening a provocative question, statistic, or bold claim (not "Today I'll talk about...")?
- Does the closing deliver a single memorable takeaway (not "Questions?" or "Thank you")?

## 2. MB/MC Balance
- Is cognitive load distributed smoothly across slides?
- Are there overloaded slides (too many ideas, text to footer)?
- Are there underloaded slides (wasted opportunity)?
- Is there deliberate rhythm between dense and light slides?

## 3. Title Quality
- Is every frame title an assertion (a claim), not a label?
- Bad: "Results", "Data", "Background"
- Good: "Distance increases abortion rates", "Standard methods fail with staggered treatment"

## 4. One Idea Per Slide
- Does any slide try to convey multiple ideas?
- Flag any slide that should be split.

## 5. Transitions
- Are transitions between slides explicit?
- Does the audience know where they are in the argument at all times?

## 6. Aristotelian Balance
- For the intended audience ([AUDIENCE TYPE]), is the ethos/pathos/logos balance appropriate?
- Is there a Devil's Advocate moment (acknowledging the strongest objection)?

## 7. Pyramid Principle
- Does each section lead with conclusions, then support?
- Or does the deck bury findings after too much background?

Return your report as a structured markdown document with:
- A rating for each criterion (Strong / Adequate / Needs Work)
- Specific slide numbers and suggested improvements
- An overall assessment
```

## Graphics Review (Phase 6)

Launch with `subagent_type: Explore` **in parallel with Phase 5**:

```
You are a graphics specialist reviewing an academic Beamer presentation.

Read the file at: [PATH TO .tex FILE]

Check for visual and technical issues:

## 1. TikZ Diagrams
- Do coordinate values match intended placement?
- Are node positions consistent with the visual layout described?
- Are labels positioned correctly (not overlapping nodes or edges)?
- Do shape constraints force any misplacement?

## 2. Figure Sizing and Placement
- Are included figures sized appropriately for the slide?
- Is there sufficient whitespace around figures?
- Are captions/labels readable at presentation size (minimum 18pt)?

## 3. Table Formatting
- Are tables clean (booktabs style, no vertical rules)?
- Is text in tables large enough to read?
- Are column widths balanced?

## 4. Colour Consistency
- Is the colour palette used consistently throughout?
- Are accent colours used for emphasis, not decoration?
- Do data visualisation colours match the deck palette?

## 5. Typography
- Is body text at least 24pt (18pt floor)?
- Maximum two font families?
- Is text ragged right (not justified)?

## 6. Numerical Accuracy
- If the deck references specific numbers, do the figures/tables match?
- Are axis scales appropriate and labeled?

Return your report as structured markdown with:
- Specific slide numbers for each issue found
- Severity (Critical / Minor / Suggestion)
- Recommended fix for each issue
