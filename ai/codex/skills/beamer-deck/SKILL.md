# Beamer Deck Skill

> Generate academic Beamer presentations with original themes, rhetoric-driven structure, and multi-agent review. Internalises Scott Cunningham's rhetoric framework and implements an adversarial review workflow.

## Purpose

Create polished, zero-warning Beamer decks for academic contexts: seminars, conference talks, teaching lectures, and working decks for coauthors. Every deck gets a custom theme, assertion-driven titles, and parallel review by rhetoric and graphics sub-agents.

**NOT for project status updates** — use `$project-deck` for those.

## When to Use

- Academic seminar presentations
- Conference talks (15–45 min)
- Teaching lectures (undergraduate or PhD)
- Working decks for coauthors or supervisors
- Any presentation that needs rhetoric discipline and visual quality

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Build artifacts go to `out/`, PDF stays in the source directory.** Create `.latexmkrc` with `$out_dir = 'out'` and an `END {}` block to copy the PDF back if missing. Use `$latex-autofix` for compilation — it handles error resolution automatically. See `$latex` for manual config details.
2. **Python:** Always use `uv run python`. Never bare `python`, `python3`, `pip`, or `pip3`.
2. **Fix ALL warnings.** Overfull hbox, underfull hbox, overfull vbox, underfull vbox — no matter how small. Parse the `.log` file. Recompile until clean.
3. **Titles are assertions, not labels.** "Distance increases abortion rates" — not "Results". Every frame title states a claim.
4. **One idea per slide.** Not a guideline. A law. If a slide has two ideas, split it.
5. **Original themes only.** Never use default Beamer themes (Warsaw, Madrid, etc.) as-is. Define colours and templates inline in the `.tex` file — no separate `.sty` files.
6. **Code-first figures.** Generate figures via R or Python scripts before inserting. Never use placeholder images.
7. **If a `.bib` file is used, validate it.** Cross-reference all `\cite{}` keys against the bibliography file. See `$validate-bib` for the full protocol.

## Rhetoric Principles

Full framework (Three Laws, MB/MC, Aristotelian Triad, Narrative Arc, Pyramid Principle, Devil's Advocate): [`../shared/rhetoric-principles.md`](../shared/rhetoric-principles.md)

## Quality Scoring

Apply numeric quality scoring using the shared framework and skill-specific rubric:

- **Framework:** [`../shared/quality-scoring.md`](../shared/quality-scoring.md) — severity tiers, thresholds, verdict rules
- **Rubric:** [`references/quality-rubric.md`](references/quality-rubric.md) — issue-to-deduction mappings for this skill

Start at 100, deduct per issue found, apply verdict. Compute the score in Phase 7 and report it in the final output.

## Context-Specific Guidance

| Audience | Ethos/Pathos/Logos | Key adjustments |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Academic seminar** | 20% / 35% / 45% | Lead with the puzzle, not the literature. Identification strategy early. One coefficient at a time. Acknowledge limitations before Q&A. |
| **Conference talk** | 25% / 35% / 40% | Emphasise identification strategy and key results. Tight narrative — no tangents. |
| **Teaching lecture** | 20% / 30% / 50% | Brevity < clarity. Repetition is allowed. Show reasoning, not just conclusions. Pause points for questions. |
| **Working deck** | 30% / 10% / 60% | Document choices (why A over B?). Preserve uncertainty. Show the math. Prioritise rigor over polish. |

## Workflow: 7 Phases

```
You (orchestrator)
├── Phase 1: Gather context        (direct)
├── Phase 2: Design structure       (direct)
├── Phase 3: Build deck             (direct)
├── Phase 4: Fix all warnings       (direct)
├── Phase 5: Rhetoric review        (sub-agent — Explore)
├── Phase 6: Graphics review        (sub-agent — Explore)  ← parallel with Phase 5
└── Phase 7: Apply & finalise       (direct)
```

### Phase 1: Gather Context (Direct)

Read project files, content sources, and audience brief. Ask the user clarifying questions:

- **Audience**: Who is this for? (seminar, conference, teaching, coauthors)
- **Duration**: How long is the talk?
- **Content source**: Paper draft? Notes? Existing slides? Code output?
- **Special requirements**: Specific figures, institutional branding, language?

Check for existing `.bib` files in the project. If citations are needed, note this for Phase 3.

### Phase 2: Design Structure (Direct)

1. **Choose rhetoric balance** based on audience (see table above)
2. **Outline slide sequence** with assertion titles — write each title as a claim
3. **Plan narrative arc** — identify Act I/II/III transitions
4. **Choose colour palette** — original, appropriate to audience tone (see Reference Palettes below for starting points)
5. **Identify figures needed** — which need to be generated via code?

Present the outline to the user for approval before building.

### Phase 3: Build Deck (Direct)

1. **Generate figures first** — run R/Python scripts, save to `figures/`
2. **Write `.tex` file** with inline theme (colours, templates, fonts — all in one file, no `.sty`)
3. **Use 16:9 aspect ratio** (`\documentclass[aspectratio=169,11pt]{beamer}`)
4. **Create `.latexmkrc`** if not present (`$out_dir = 'out'` + `END {}` block to copy PDF back)
5. **Compile using `$latex-autofix`** — this handles missing packages, font conflicts, citation key mismatches, and stale cache automatically
6. **If using citations**: add `\addbibresource{paperpile.bib}` or `\bibliography{}` as appropriate

### Phase 4: Fix All Warnings (Direct)

After `$latex-autofix` resolves errors, address remaining **warnings** (which autofix does not fix):

1. Parse `out/*.log` for overfull/underfull hbox/vbox warnings
2. Fix every single one — adjust text, resize figures, tweak `\parbox`, etc.
3. Recompile
4. Repeat until the log is clean

**"Compilation success does not mean visual success."** Also check for silent visual errors:
- TikZ: shape constraints forcing label misplacement, coordinate misalignment. **If the deck contains TikZ diagrams**, run the 5-pass verification from [`references/tikz-rules.md`](references/tikz-rules.md) — compute Bezier depths, check gaps, verify label fit.
- ggplot/matplotlib output: axis labels cut off, legend obscuring data, text sizing
- **PDF visual inspection**: Run `uv run python scripts/pdf-to-images.py <deck>.pdf` to convert pages to images, then inspect each image for text overflow, element overlap, font readability, and alignment issues that are invisible in the log

### Phase 5: Rhetoric Review (Sub-Agent — Explore)

Launch a sub-agent to review the `.tex` file against 7 criteria: narrative arc, MB/MC balance, title quality, one-idea-per-slide, transitions, Aristotelian balance, and pyramid principle.

Full prompt template: [`references/review-prompts.md`](references/review-prompts.md) § Rhetoric Review

### Phase 6: Graphics Review (Sub-Agent — Explore)

Launch **in parallel with Phase 5**. Reviews TikZ diagrams, figure sizing, table formatting, colour consistency, typography, and numerical accuracy.

Full prompt template: [`references/review-prompts.md`](references/review-prompts.md) § Graphics Review

### Phase 7: Apply and Finalise (Direct)

1. Read both reviewer reports
2. Incorporate feedback — prioritise Critical and Needs Work items
3. Recompile
4. Verify zero warnings in the log
5. **If using a `.bib` file**: validate all `\cite{}` keys resolve correctly (check log for `Citation .* undefined`). See `$validate-bib` for the full cross-referencing protocol.
6. If significant changes were made, loop back to Phase 5 for another review round
7. **Compute quality score** — read `references/quality-rubric.md`, log all issues from Phases 4-6, compute score and verdict
8. Confirm final PDF is in the source directory (copied from `out/` by `.latexmkrc`)

## Reference Palettes

Three starting palettes (Professional, Energetic, Academic) in both LaTeX and CSS formats: [`../shared/palettes.md`](../shared/palettes.md)

Use as inspiration — always create an original palette for each deck.
