## Automatic Model Selection

This skill features **intelligent model selection** based on query complexity:

### Model Types

**1. Sonar Pro Search** (`perplexity/sonar-pro-search`)
- **Use Case**: Straightforward information lookup
- **Best For**: 
  - Simple fact-finding queries
  - Recent publication searches
  - Basic protocol lookups
  - Statistical data retrieval
- **Speed**: Fast responses
- **Cost**: Lower cost per query

**2. Sonar Reasoning Pro** (`perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro`)
- **Use Case**: Complex analytical queries requiring deep reasoning
- **Best For**:
  - Comparative analysis ("compare X vs Y")
  - Synthesis of multiple studies
  - Evaluating trade-offs or controversies
  - Explaining mechanisms or relationships
  - Critical analysis and interpretation
- **Speed**: Slower but more thorough
- **Cost**: Higher cost per query, but provides deeper insights

### Complexity Assessment

The skill automatically detects query complexity using these indicators:

**Reasoning Keywords** (triggers Sonar Reasoning Pro):
- Analytical: `compare`, `contrast`, `analyze`, `analysis`, `evaluate`, `critique`
- Comparative: `versus`, `vs`, `vs.`, `compared to`, `differences between`, `similarities`
- Synthesis: `meta-analysis`, `systematic review`, `synthesis`, `integrate`
- Causal: `mechanism`, `why`, `how does`, `how do`, `explain`, `relationship`, `causal relationship`, `underlying mechanism`
- Theoretical: `theoretical framework`, `implications`, `interpret`, `reasoning`
- Debate: `controversy`, `conflicting`, `paradox`, `debate`, `reconcile`
- Trade-offs: `pros and cons`, `advantages and disadvantages`, `trade-off`, `tradeoff`, `trade offs`
- Complexity: `multifaceted`, `complex interaction`, `critical analysis`

**Complexity Scoring**:
- Reasoning keywords: 3 points each (heavily weighted)
- Multiple questions: 2 points per question mark
- Complex sentence structures: 1.5 points per clause indicator (and, or, but, however, whereas, although)
- Very long queries: 1 point if >150 characters
- **Threshold**: Queries scoring ≥3 points trigger Sonar Reasoning Pro

**Practical Result**: Even a single strong reasoning keyword (compare, explain, analyze, etc.) will trigger the more powerful Sonar Reasoning Pro model, ensuring you get deep analysis when needed.

**Example Query Classification**:

✅ **Sonar Pro Search** (straightforward lookup):
- "Recent advances in CRISPR gene editing 2024"
- "Prevalence of diabetes in US population"
- "Western blot protocol for protein detection"

✅ **Sonar Reasoning Pro** (complex analysis):
- "Compare and contrast mRNA vaccines vs traditional vaccines for cancer treatment"
- "Explain the mechanism underlying the relationship between gut microbiome and depression"
- "Analyze the controversy surrounding AI in medical diagnosis and evaluate trade-offs"

### Manual Override

You can force a specific model using the `force_model` parameter:

```python
# Force Sonar Pro Search for fast lookup
research = ResearchLookup(force_model='pro')

# Force Sonar Reasoning Pro for deep analysis
research = ResearchLookup(force_model='reasoning')

# Automatic selection (default)
research = ResearchLookup()
```

Command-line usage:
```bash
# Force Sonar Pro Search
python research_lookup.py "your query" --force-model pro

# Force Sonar Reasoning Pro
python research_lookup.py "your query" --force-model reasoning

# Automatic (no flag)
python research_lookup.py "your query"

# Save output to a file
python research_lookup.py "your query" -o results.txt

# Output as JSON (useful for programmatic access)
python research_lookup.py "your query" --json

# Combine: JSON output saved to file
python research_lookup.py "your query" --json -o results.json
```

3. Chen et al. (2022), NEJM (IF: 158.5, cited 890+ times)
   - Landmark clinical trial (N=5,000)
   - Key finding: [finding]
```

## Query Best Practices

### 1. Model Selection Strategy

**For Simple Lookups (Sonar Pro Search)**:
- Recent papers on a specific topic
- Statistical data or prevalence rates
- Standard protocols or methodologies
- Citation finding for specific papers
- Factual information retrieval

**For Complex Analysis (Sonar Reasoning Pro)**:
- Comparative studies and synthesis
- Mechanism explanations
- Controversy evaluation
- Trade-off analysis
- Theoretical frameworks
- Multi-faceted relationships

**Pro Tip**: The automatic selection is optimized for most use cases. Only use `force_model` if you have specific requirements or know the query needs deeper reasoning than detected.

### 2. Specific and Focused Queries

**Good Queries** (will trigger appropriate model):
- "Randomized controlled trials of mRNA vaccines for cancer treatment 2023-2024" → Sonar Pro Search
- "Compare the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines vs traditional vaccines for cancer treatment" → Sonar Reasoning Pro
- "Explain the mechanism by which CRISPR off-target effects occur and strategies to minimize them" → Sonar Reasoning Pro

**Poor Queries**:
- "Tell me about AI" (too broad)
- "Cancer research" (lacks specificity)
- "Latest news" (too vague)

### 3. Structured Query Format

**Recommended Structure**:
```
[Topic] + [Specific Aspect] + [Time Frame] + [Type of Information]
```

**Examples**:
- "CRISPR gene editing + off-target effects + 2024 + clinical trials"
- "Quantum computing + error correction + recent advances + review papers"
- "Renewable energy + solar efficiency + 2023-2024 + statistical data"

### 4. Follow-up Queries

**Effective Follow-ups**:
- "Show me the full citation for the Smith et al. 2024 paper"
- "What are the limitations of this methodology?"
- "Find similar studies using different approaches"
- "What controversies exist in this research area?"

## Integration with Scientific Writing

This skill enhances scientific writing by providing:

1. **Literature Review Support**: Gather current research for introduction and discussion sections
