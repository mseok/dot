# Devil's Advocate Skill

> Challenge research assumptions and identify weaknesses in your arguments.

## Purpose

Based on Scott Cunningham's Part 3: "Creating Devil's Advocate Agents for Tough Problems" - addressing the "LLM thing of over-confidence in diagnosing a problem."

**For formal code audits with replication scripts and referee reports, use the Referee 2 agent instead (`.codex/agents/referee2-reviewer.md`).** This skill is for quick adversarial feedback on arguments, not systematic audits.

## When to Use

- Before submitting a paper
- When stuck on a research problem
- When you want to stress-test an argument
- During paper revision planning

## When NOT to Use

- **Code audits** — use the Referee 2 agent instead
- **Replication verification** — use the Referee 2 agent instead
- **Quick proofreading** — just ask for a read-through
- **When you want validation** — this skill is designed to challenge, not affirm

## Workflow

1. **Understand the claim** — Read the paper/argument being evaluated
2. **Generate competing hypotheses** — If evaluating a research question or design, load `references/competing-hypotheses.md` and generate 3-5 rival explanations before critiquing
3. **Run the debate** — Use the multi-turn debate protocol below (default) or single-shot mode for quick checks
4. **Deliver the verdict** — Synthesize surviving critiques with severity ratings

## Multi-Turn Debate Protocol (Default)

Inspired by the simulated scientific debates in Google's AI Co-Scientist. A one-shot critique is easy for an LLM to produce but often superficial. Multi-turn debates force each critique to survive a defense, filtering out weak objections and sharpening the strong ones.

### Round 1: Adversarial Critic

Adopt the persona of a hostile but competent reviewer. Challenge on:
1. **Theoretical foundations** — Are the assumptions justified?
2. **Methodology** — Limitations? Alternative approaches?
3. **Data** — Selection bias? Measurement issues? External validity?
4. **Causal claims** — Alternative explanations? Confounders?
5. **Contribution** — Novel enough? Does it matter?

Produce **numbered critiques** (aim for 5-8), each with a concrete statement of the problem.

### Round 2: Defense

Switch persona to the paper's author. For each numbered critique, provide the strongest possible defense:
- Cite evidence from the paper that addresses the concern
- Explain design choices that mitigate the issue
- Acknowledge limitations honestly where the defense is weak
- Propose concrete fixes where the critique has merit

### Round 3: Adjudication

Switch to an impartial senior reviewer. For each critique-defense pair, rule:
- **Critique stands** — the defense is insufficient; this is a real weakness
- **Critique partially addressed** — defense has merit but issue remains
- **Critique resolved** — the defense adequately addresses the concern

### Final Synthesis

Produce a structured report with only the surviving critiques (stands + partially addressed), ranked by severity:

```markdown
## Devil's Advocate Report

### Critical (must fix before submission)
1. [Critique] — [Why the defense failed] — [Suggested fix]

### Major (reviewers will likely raise)
2. [Critique] — [What remains after defense] — [Suggested fix]

### Minor (worth acknowledging)
3. [Critique] — [Residual concern] — [How to preempt]

### Dismissed
- [Critiques that were resolved in Round 2, listed briefly for transparency]
```

## Single-Shot Mode

For quick checks (e.g., "just poke holes in this argument"), skip the multi-turn protocol and produce a direct critique. Use when the user says "quick", "just challenge this", or the input is a paragraph rather than a full paper.

## Example Use

"Play devil's advocate on my MCDM paper about preference drift - specifically challenge my identification strategy and the assumptions about utility functions."
