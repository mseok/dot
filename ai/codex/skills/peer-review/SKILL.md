# Scientific Critical Evaluation and Peer Review

## Overview

Peer review is a systematic process for evaluating scientific manuscripts. Assess methodology, statistics, design, reproducibility, ethics, and reporting standards. Apply this skill for manuscript and grant review across disciplines with constructive, rigorous evaluation.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Conducting peer review of scientific manuscripts for journals
- Evaluating grant proposals and research applications
- Assessing methodology and experimental design rigor
- Reviewing statistical analyses and reporting standards
- Evaluating reproducibility and data availability
- Checking compliance with reporting guidelines (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA)
- Providing constructive feedback on scientific writing

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

**When creating documents with this skill, always consider adding scientific diagrams and schematics to enhance visual communication.**

If your document does not already contain schematics or diagrams:
- Use the **scientific-schematics** skill to generate AI-powered publication-quality diagrams
- Simply describe your desired diagram in natural language
- Nano Banana Pro will automatically generate, review, and refine the schematic

**For new documents:** Scientific schematics should be generated by default to visually represent key concepts, workflows, architectures, or relationships described in the text.

**How to generate schematics:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o figures/output.png
```

The AI will automatically:
- Create publication-quality images with proper formatting
- Review and refine through multiple iterations
- Ensure accessibility (colorblind-friendly, high contrast)
- Save outputs in the figures/ directory

**When to add schematics:**
- Peer review workflow diagrams
- Evaluation criteria decision trees
- Review process flowcharts
- Methodology assessment frameworks
- Quality assessment visualizations
- Reporting guidelines compliance diagrams
- Any complex concept that benefits from visualization

For detailed guidance on creating schematics, refer to the scientific-schematics skill documentation.

### Presentations and Slide Decks

**⚠️ CRITICAL: For presentations, NEVER read the PDF directly. ALWAYS convert to images first.**

When reviewing scientific presentations (PowerPoint, Beamer, slide decks):

#### Mandatory Image-Based Review Workflow

**NEVER attempt to read presentation PDFs directly** - this causes buffer overflow errors and doesn't show visual formatting issues.

**Required Process:**
1. Convert PDF to images using Python:
   ```bash
   python skills/scientific-slides/scripts/pdf_to_images.py presentation.pdf review/slide --dpi 150
   # Creates: review/slide-001.jpg, review/slide-002.jpg, etc.
   ```
2. Read and inspect EACH slide image file sequentially
3. Document issues with specific slide numbers
4. Provide feedback on visual formatting and content

**Print when starting review:**
```
[HH:MM:SS] PEER REVIEW: Presentation detected - converting to images for review
[HH:MM:SS] PDF REVIEW: NEVER reading PDF directly - using image-based inspection
```

[14:30:00] PEER REVIEW: Starting review of presentation
[14:30:05] PEER REVIEW: Presentation detected - converting to images
[14:30:10] PDF REVIEW: Running pdf_to_images.py on presentation.pdf
[14:30:15] PDF REVIEW: Converted 25 slides to images in review/ directory
[14:30:20] PDF REVIEW: Inspecting slide 1/25 - title slide
[14:30:25] PDF REVIEW: Inspecting slide 2/25 - introduction
...
[14:35:40] PDF REVIEW: Inspecting slide 25/25 - acknowledgments
[14:35:45] PDF REVIEW: Completed image-based review
[14:35:50] PEER REVIEW: Found 8 layout issues, 3 content issues
