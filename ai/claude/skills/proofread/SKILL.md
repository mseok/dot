# Academic Proofreading

**Report-only skill.** Never edit source files — produce `PROOFREAD-REPORT.md` only.

## When to Use

- Before sending a draft to supervisors
- Before submission to a journal/conference
- After major revisions to check consistency
- When you want a fresh-eyes check on writing quality

## When NOT to Use

- **Formal audits** — use the Referee 2 agent for systematic verification
- **Argument quality** — use `$devils-advocate` for logical scrutiny
- **Citation completeness** — use `$validate-bib` for bibliography cross-referencing (though this skill flags obvious citation format issues)

## Workflow

1. **Locate files**: Find all `.tex` files in the project (and `.log` files for LaTeX diagnostics)
2. **Read the document**: Read all `.tex` source files in order
3. **Run 7 check categories** (below)
4. **Produce report**: Write `PROOFREAD-REPORT.md` in a `proofread/` subfolder of the project directory (create it if it does not exist)

## Check Categories

### 1. Grammar & Spelling

- Spelling errors (including technical terms)
- Subject-verb agreement
- Sentence fragments or run-ons
- Misused words (e.g., "effect" vs "affect", "which" vs "that")
- American English is the default for all papers and conference articles. Flag any British English spellings (e.g., -ise, -our, -re, analyse, scepticism).

### 2. Notation Consistency

- Variable notation used consistently throughout (e.g., always `$x_i$` or always `$x_{i}$`, not both)
- Subscript/superscript style (e.g., `$\beta_1$` vs `$\beta_{OLS}$`)
- Matrix/vector formatting conventions (bold, uppercase, etc.)
- Consistent use of `\mathbb`, `\mathcal`, `\mathbf` for sets, operators, vectors
- Equation numbering: all referenced equations numbered, unreferenced ones unnumbered

### 3. Citation Format

- Consistent use of `\citet` (textual) vs `\citep` (parenthetical)
- No raw `\cite{}` when `\citet`/`\citep` is available
- Author name spelling matches between text mentions and citation keys
- Multiple citations in chronological or alphabetical order (check which convention)
- No "As shown by (Author, Year)" — should be "As shown by \citet{key}"

### 4. Academic Tone

- No informal contractions (don't, can't, won't → do not, cannot, will not)
- No first-person overuse (some "we" is fine; excessive "I think" is not)
- No casual hedging ("pretty much", "kind of", "a lot")
- Appropriate use of hedging language ("suggests" vs "proves")
- No exclamation marks in body text
- Consistent tense (present for established facts, past for specific studies)

### 5. LaTeX-Specific Issues

- **Overfull hbox**: Check `.log` file for `Overfull \hbox` warnings — report line numbers and severity (badness)
- **Equation overflow**: Long equations that exceed column/page width
- **Float placement**: Check for `[h!]` or `[H]` overuse; prefer `[tbp]`
- **Missing labels**: Figures/tables/equations referenced but without `\label{}`
- **Orphan/widow lines**: Check for `\\` abuse that creates bad page breaks
- **Unresolved references**: `??` in output indicating broken `\ref{}` or `\cite{}`

### 6. Citation Voice Balance

Check the ratio of in-line (`\citet`) to parenthetical (`\citep`) citations:

- **Count in-line vs parenthetical citations** across the full document
- **Flag if ratio exceeds 1:1** (in-line should be the minority) — Major
- **Flag runs of 3+ consecutive in-line citations** in a paragraph or section — Major
- **Flag paragraphs that open with an in-line citation** when the author's identity isn't the point — Minor
- **Flag "As shown by \citet{}" patterns** where parenthetical would be more natural — Minor
- **Report the overall ratio** (e.g., "42 parenthetical, 28 in-line — ratio 1.5:1")

See `docs/conventions.md` § Citation Voice Balance for the full convention.

### 7. TikZ Diagram Review

If the document contains TikZ code (`\begin{tikzpicture}` or `\tikz`):

- **Label positioning**: Labels not overlapping nodes or edges
- **Geometric accuracy**: Coordinates and angles consistent with intended layout
- **Visual semantics**: Arrow styles match meaning (solid = direct, dashed = indirect, etc.)
- **Spacing**: Nodes not too cramped or too spread out
- **Consistency**: Style matches across all diagrams in the document
- **Standalone compilability**: Each diagram should compile independently

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Critical** | Will be noticed by reviewers, may cause rejection | Broken references, major grammar errors, inconsistent core notation |
| **Major** | Noticeable quality issue | Inconsistent citation style, tone issues, overfull hbox > 10pt |
| **Minor** | Polish issue | Occasional British/American mix, minor spacing |

## Quality Scoring

Apply numeric quality scoring using the shared framework and skill-specific rubric:

- **Framework:** [`../shared/quality-scoring.md`](../shared/quality-scoring.md) — severity tiers, thresholds, verdict rules
- **Rubric:** [`references/quality-rubric.md`](references/quality-rubric.md) — issue-to-deduction mappings for this skill

Start at 100, deduct per issue found, apply verdict. Insert the Score Block into the report after the summary table.

- **`$validate-bib`** — For thorough bibliography cross-referencing
- **Referee 2 agent** — For formal code + paper auditing
- **`$devils-advocate`** — For argument quality and logical scrutiny
